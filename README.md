# Automated-Scripts-Public
A public version of my automated scripts repo

- **Debt Management Automation**: Implemented a script to automate the payment process for Klarna transactions, which required reverse engineering Klarna's API and seamless integration with Google Calendar for payment reminders.
- **Gift Card Tracking**: Created a system to track the balance and expiry of ASDA gift cards, involving automated email forwarding to S3, triggering a Lambda function that updates Google Photos for easy access to gift card information.
- **Crypto Cashback Tracking**: Designed a tool to track the status of Plutus crypto cashback rewards, adding calendar events for reward release dates and identifying rejected transactions using hidden API endpoints.
- **Unidays Renewal**: Auto renewing student membership.
